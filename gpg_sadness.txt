This is usually caused by your firewall blocking the port 11371. You could unblock the port in your firewall. In case you don't have access to the firewall you could either:

    Force it to use port 80 instead of 11371

    gpg --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys 94558F59

    Alternatively
        Find and open the key from the key server.
        Copy it's contents into a text file.
        Go to System Tool > Preferences > Software Sources > Authentication > Add key, and select the text file created. For Ubuntu 14.04 and later try: Software Center -> Edit -> Software Sources -> Authentication -> Import key file


> gpg --import key.txt if you need to import via command line FYI.
